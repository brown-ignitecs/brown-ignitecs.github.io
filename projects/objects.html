	<h1>Objects</h1>
	<div>Here is the code we will be working with today: <a href="https://repl.it/@nereed19/Objects">Click here for code!</a></div>
	
	<h2>Here is what you need to do today:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a new friend for the lonely person using <font color="red">let friend = ...</font></li>
		<li>Try out some different combinations for people like use the bow head instead of the bald head</li>
		<li>Add some new attributes to the person?  Like make it so the person can keep track of eyecolor in the constructor</li>
		<li>Change drawFeatures() so that it also prints out eye color</li>
		<li>Change says to "I have" + this.eye_color so the person says what eye color they have</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Here are reminders of what we talked about in class:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Classes are like collections of information.  In this example, we have a class Person, which represents what information we might want to remember about a person</li>
		<li>Classes have <font color="red">attributes and methods</font>
			<ul>
				<li>Attributes are pieces of information to remember.  Example: you might want to remember what kind of hair someone has</li>
					<ul>
						<li>this.thing is an attribute</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Methods are remembering how to do something.  Example: you might want to remember how to walk by putting one foot in front of the other</li>
					<ul>
						<li>thing(){} is a method</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>The constructor is where you say how to create the class (in our example, where we say how we will create a person)</li>
		<li>To tell the constructor to create a class, we say <font color="red">let person = new Person(&quot;name&quot;,age,&quot;what they will say&quot;, &quot;head type&quot;, &quot;eye type&quot;, &quot;mouth type&quot;, &quot;arm type&quot;);</font></li>
		
	</ul>
